I can still remember the shore we saw that day...
The words we wrote in the sand... the sight of you as you turned away
The waves ebb and flow across my feet, carrying something away
In the evening calm, twilight alone passes me by

We watched fireworks blooming in a flash of light
Surely this summer is far from over
And has unraveled our uncertain hearts, tying them together
I wanted this night to go on forever

I wonder how many times I'll be able to watch the same fireworks as you
What can I do for the sake of your smiling face?
Feeling hurt, feeling happy... repetitive waves and regularities
Uneasiness and the sound of the evening's last train
Again and again, I’ll put it into words, and call to you
Seeking the pause between waves, I’ll try once again...
So that you'll never have to feel sad again

A light that seemed it might disappear if we let out a gasp
Surely remained within our hearts
A warm future we felt when we reached out our hands
Was secretly watching us

Fireworks, in flash of light
Bloomed in the night
They bloomed in the night
And disappeared silently
Don't let go (Don't go away)
Just a little longer
Let us stay like this
Just a little longer

I can still remember the shore we saw that day...
The words we wrote in the sand... the sight of you as you turned away

We watched fireworks blooming in a flash of light
Surely this summer is far from over
And has unraveled our uncertain hearts, tying them together
I wanted this night to go on forever
